# Healthcare-AI-Patient-Clustering-for-Preventive-Care

**Overview**

The Healthcare AI Patient Clustering platform leverages Machine Learning to segment patients based on health and lifestyle data. By grouping patients with similar risk profiles, the system enables targeted preventive care and early intervention strategies, helping healthcare providers improve patient outcomes and resource allocation.

**Key Features**

- Patient Clustering: Groups patients based on features like age, BMI, activity level, and vital signs.

- Risk Profiling: Identifies high-risk patients for timely preventive care.

- Data Visualization: Uses plots to illustrate clusters and feature distributions.

- Machine Learning Techniques: Implements K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and PCA for dimensionality reduction.

- Interactive Analysis: Facilitates exploration of patient segments for healthcare decision-making.

**Problem Statement**

Healthcare providers face challenges such as:

- Difficulty in identifying at-risk patients for preventive interventions.
  
- Resource misallocation due to undifferentiated patient populations.

- Limited insights from raw patient data.

This platform addresses these issues through AI-driven patient segmentation and visualization.

**Tech Stack**

- Programming Language: Python

- Machine Learning: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA

- Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib

- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

**Dataset Structure**

The dataset includes key patient features:

- Demographics: Age, Gender

- Lifestyle: Physical Activity, Sleep Duration, Stress Levels

- Health Metrics: BMI, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Lab Test Results

- Target : Disease or risk indicators

**Project Workflow**

1. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.

2. Feature Analysis & EDA

- Explore correlations and distributions using visualizations.

3. Clustering Module

- Apply K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to segment patients.

- Reduce dimensionality with PCA for better visualization.

4. Cluster Interpretation

- Analyze patient groups to identify high-risk profiles and preventive care recommendations.

5. Visualization & Reporting

- Generate cluster plots, feature importance charts, and summary reports.

**Impact**

- Improved identification of high-risk patient groups

- Enhanced preventive care strategies

- Efficient allocation of healthcare resources

- Better decision-making for healthcare providers

**Future Enhancements**

- Integrate real-time patient monitoring data

- Deploy interactive dashboards for healthcare professionals

- Apply predictive models for disease onset in high-risk clusters
